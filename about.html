          When it comes to my education, I hold a bachelor's degree in social
          animation, a master's degree in resocialization pedagogy with elements
          of psychotherapy, and a postgraduate degree in psychosomatics and
          somatopsychology. Additionally, I have completed a two-level training
          in Solution-Focused Therapy. During my studies, I was a member of the
          Scientific Sexology Circle for two years. My bachelor's thesis focused
          on stereotypes towards lesbians, while my master's thesis explored how
          foreigners perceive the identity of Gdynia’s residents in urban space.
          At one point, I even considered a doctoral path, but life outside
          academia captivated me, leading me to become a therapist and a
          companion in change rather than a researcher.<br /><br />I have also
          participated in international training programs, mainly focused on
          embodiment (primarily bodywork methods, mindfulness, and nature-based
          personal development techniques). I have completed a massage course
          and attended various workshops to enhance my qualifications and
          personal growth (including motivational interviewing,
          anti-discrimination training, and an introduction to Dance Movement
          Therapy). <br /><br />

          I am a circle woman, a student of Tanna Jakubowicz-Mount and Mona
          Cichoń. For two years, I participated in the developmental process
          "Guides on the Path//My Medicine," led by Tanna. During this time, I
          underwent my initiation process and received the name Flora Flow—"the
          one who touches with her heart." In this way, I became my own guide in
          discovering my inner medicine and do my best to support others,
          especially women, in uncovering their power and gifts. For the past
          four years, I have been leading a women's development group.
          <br /><br />I am a member of the Educational Cha(lle)nge Association,
          where we strive to transform education through workshops for students
          and teachers, as well as annual conferences. <br /><br />

        <p class="mainText3">
          I collaborate with the Pomeranian Center for Psychotherapy and
          Psychoeducation, the Children's Development Studio “Alterway,” the
          Youth Cooperation Center, and the Emigration Museum. In the past, I
          have facilitated processes for organizations such as TEB Edukacja,
          Dovista, LPP, Arla, Lifeworks, and Citi. <br /><br />Throughout my
          life, I have done many different things... I have worked as a nanny,
          an art teacher, a caregiver in a Daily Support Facility, and as a
          project coordinator and trainer at CWM. I have conducted intimacy
          workshops in Riga, practiced Contact Improvisation dance, and led
          workshops on identity. In the past, I also taught djembe drumming and
          led archery workshops. <br /><br />I believe that these diverse
          experiences allow me to see the world from multiple perspectives.
